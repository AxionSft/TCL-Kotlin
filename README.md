## Get start

If you are here you need to setup our project!. Please follow this steps:

* Open the file "build.gradle"
* 1 - Change the line 26 with your group id ex: "io.github.axst"
* 2 - Change the line 19 with your tweaker name or client name (will be the most important part of this setup) (dont touch "mixins.")
* 3 - Change the line 18 "io.github.axst.launch.TCLTweaker" to your tweaker dir!
* 4 - Change the line 25 with your client version
* Open the file "mixins.tcl.json"
* 5 - Change the line 5 with your package where mixins should be.
* 6 - Change the line 6 "mixins.tcl.refmap.json" to "mixins.TWEAKER-OR-CLIENT-NAME-STEP-2.refmap.json" please use the tweaker or client name in step 2!
* 7 - Now the client should work! have fun learing mixins!
* 8 - If the client wont start make sure to set the package to MAIN and not API. (IJ IDEA)
